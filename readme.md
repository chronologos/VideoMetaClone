##Purpose
A script for tagging videos encoded using Handbrake. After Handbrake encodes video files, the creation date of the encoded file is no longer the date of filming. This script corrects this.

*For Python 2.x*

##Instructions
1. Place all the originals + encoded files in the same folder with the script
2. Make sure that after encoding the encoded files have the same filename (except extension of course) as the original
3. Run the script
4. Tada!
